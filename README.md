# Advanced-Programming
# Introduction

This repository contains my work from the **Advanced Programming** course, the most challenging and complex subject I have taken so far. It required deep problem-solving skills and a strong understanding of **data structures, recursion, and algorithms**.

## Learning Experience

This course heavily focused on **trees**, a topic that I initially found particularly difficult. Alongside trees, I also worked extensively with **various data structures, recursion, and complex algorithms**, such as **backtracking**.

Throughout the course, I faced numerous challenges that pushed me to think more critically and write more efficient code. Despite the difficulty, it was one of the most rewarding learning experiences, as it helped me develop a much stronger foundation in algorithm design and problem-solving.

## Conclusion

While this was one of the toughest courses I've taken, it was also one of the most valuable. The struggle to understand these concepts ultimately helped me grow significantly as a programmer.  
This repository reflects the effort, challenges, and progress I made throughout the journey of mastering **Advanced Programming**.
